- main branch is where everybody merges to
- feature-1 is our personal local branch for this feature


What are the three different options to merge:
    => fast-forward (we will never have merge conflicts, just moving the "pointer")
    => rebase something and then fast-forward
        1. rebase
        2. merge
    => not fast-forward ("merge commit")
        => this is my personal default, but I deactivated it now.


some of the commands I used today:
git rebase main -i
git rebase main
git reset @^ --soft
git reset @^ --hard (be careful to not loose things you'd want to keep :D)
git reset @^
git diff @^..@
git merge feature-1
git cherry-pick feature-1
git cherry-pick e122ab3
tig
